# Changelog

The `zombiesplit` protocol adheres to _semantic versioning_:

1. Once servers start checking the semantic version, the semantic version will
   start incrementing.
2. Once the protocol 'feels complete', it will move to version 1.0 and any
   changes to the protobuf that break deserialisation will increment the major
   version; else, they will increment the minor or patch version according to
   severity.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
